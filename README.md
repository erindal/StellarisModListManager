# StellarisModListManager

A simple mod list manager for Stellaris 2.3. Currently only supports Windows OS.

NEWS 11/3/19: A rebuilt version will come for the new launcher. It should be a lot easier to do as all the data is in a json format.

Built on Python 3.7.4

GUI built with appJar

User Guide (2.0 Beta):

Your current mod list is stored in your documents by Stellaris.
SMLM will store its own copies of any mod lists you create or import as a profile.
You can edit the list independently in SMLM and activate it once you're satisfied.

To make a mod list:

There are two ways:

You can use the Stellaris Launcher to select your mods as your normally would.
Once you've done so, use the Profile>Import menu option.
There you can enter a name and set the Stellaris version.
Your mod list is now saved.

You can also create a new profile in SMLM by going to Profile>Create New Profile.
There you can select your mods from the list on the left.

To use a mod list:

When you start the application, there won't a profile selected.
You can use the Profile>Change Profile menu option to select a previously created profile.
Once you've done so, you can then press the Activate button at the bottom.
This will modify your Stellaris mod list.

Upon changing profile, the right side of the screen will show active mods.
The left side will show available mods.

Previous users:

If you have a mod list made with a pre 2.0 version, load it into Stellaris with the old version and then use the import option in 2.0+
