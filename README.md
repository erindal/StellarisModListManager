# StellarisModListManager

News 2/23/2020:
3.1 has a beta live with sharing! Make sure you read the build notes carefully.

A simple mod list manager for Stellaris 2.4+. Currently only supports Windows OS. Built on Python 3

How to use:
Stellaris stores your load order and selected mods in a Documents folder. Stellaris Mod List Manager helps automate changing between different sets of mods (for instance, a mod set you use in singleplayer and a mod set a multiplayer group uses). SMLM also helps facilitate the sharing of mod lists (provided you are subscribed to them via Steam Workshop), to help solve issues in setting up multiplayer games.

Download and extract a release from the releases section on github. Inside is an executable file (main.exe). This starts the program.

Once started, you can enter a number from the list to run the designated function. Most of them are self explanatory, however a few points:

- You must choose your mods in the Stellaris launcher before opening SMLM to sort them/save the mod list.
- If you sort, load a previously saved mod list, or import someone else's shared mod list, you must apply the changes to Stellaris using option 3 for them to take effect. SMLM will attempt to warn you if you try to exit without saving or applying.
- It's recommended you include the current Stellaris version in the name when saving your mod list.
- Sorting is reverse alphabetical, which is done to retain the previous functionality of how certain mods overwrite others. If you need a specific load order that isn't reverse alphabetical, don't use the sorting function.
