# StellarisModListManager
A simple mod list manager for Stellaris.

Built on Python 3.6.5

User Guide (v0.1):

Your current mod list is stored in your documents by Stellaris. This program will store that file seperately and automate loading it when you want to change you mod list.

To make a modlist and save it:
1. Select your mods as you normally would in the Stellaris Launcher
2. Close the launcher (this is important)
3. Run the program, type save
4. Enter a name
5. You're done

The list is now stored in a folder under the same directory as your settings.

You can now open the launcher, change your mod list, close it, and save a new mod list.

To load a list again, type load, then enter the name you saved the list under (the program will give you a file list if you forget).

You can also type "read" to list what mods are currently enabled.
